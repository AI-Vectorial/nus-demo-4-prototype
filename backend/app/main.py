"""M04 Policy Assistant — backend API.

THE SCAFFOLD. Everything needed to serve, test and deploy -- and nothing that
answers a question. Ingestion, retrieval, refusal, generation and the /ask
endpoint are yours to build.

Start with docs/PRD.md for what must be true, and docs/features.md for what to
build first. START-HERE.md is your first two minutes.
